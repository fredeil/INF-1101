# SORTING

1. Overview:

    Sorting algorithms for integer arrays:
        - bubblesort
        - insertion sort
        - selection sort
        - quicksort
        - mergesort
        - heapsort

2. Build project:
    run "make"

3. Run:
    ./assert_sort \<size of test data set\>

    WARNING: Testing with large data sets will require a big memory pool.
    A size of 1000000000 (one billion) will require approximately 12 GB of memory.

    Turn on data set printing: Run with -p
